# Weather Data Visualizer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes weather data using Python to demonstrate data acquisition, cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.  
It highlights climate variability and provides insights into temperature, humidity, and rainfall patterns.

## 📂 Dataset Description
- **Source:** [Weather Dataset (CSV)](https://github.com/iamutkarsh24/Weather-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Weather_Dataset.csv)  
- **Raw file:** `data/weather_raw.csv`  
- **Cleaned file:** `data/weather_cleaned.csv`  

### Columns in Dataset
- `Date/Time` → converted to `date` (datetime format)  
- `Temp_C` → renamed to `temperature` (°C)  
- `Rel Hum_%` → renamed to `humidity` (%)  
- `Weather` → renamed to `condition` (used as proxy for rainfall events)  
- Additional columns: `dew_point`, `wind_speed`, `visibility`, `pressure`

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** → data loading, cleaning, grouping, aggregation  
- **NumPy** → statistical analysis (mean, min, max, std deviation)  
- **Matplotlib** → visualization (line, bar, scatter, combined plots)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → interactive analysis and step‑wise execution  

---

## 📊 Results
### Statistical Analysis
- **Daily:** Mean and standard deviation of temperature.  
- **Monthly:** Average, min, max, and std deviation for temperature and humidity.  
- **Yearly:** Climate trends across years.  

### Visualizations
- **Line Chart:** Daily temperature trends.  
- **Bar Chart:** Monthly rainfall proxy (rainy days count from `condition`).  
- **Scatter Plot:** Humidity vs Temperature relationship.  
- **Combined Plots:** Temperature trend + Humidity vs Temperature.  

All plots are saved in the `images/` folder.

## 📑 Report
- A detailed summary of insights is documented in `report/summary.md`.  
- Key findings include seasonal temperature variation, rainfall distribution, and humidity correlations.
